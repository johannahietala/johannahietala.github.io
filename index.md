Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

## Paragraphs
> 1. In the box below, insert the necessary number of spaces to make the poem render correctly:

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
  If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!
